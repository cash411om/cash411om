Payday Lending in America” series produced by Pew’s small-dollar loans project. Problems in the online payday loan market have been chronicled anecdotally, but Pew’s report is the first formal analysis to use surveys and focus groups, consumer complaints, company filings, and lenders’ spending on advertising and prospective-borrower leads.

“Our report makes clear that abusive practices in the online payday loan market not only exist but are widespread,” says Nick Bourke, Pew’s small-dollar loans project director. “State and federal regulators have taken steps to rein in fraud and abuse, but they need to do considerably more to keep borrowers from being harmed or further entrenched in unaffordable debt, especially as these loans become more prevalent.” 

The report found that aggressive and illegal actions are concentrated among the approximately 70 percent of lenders that are not licensed in every state where they lend and among fraudulent debt collectors. Such lenders claim to be exempt from the authority of state-level officials, so federal action will be necessary to stop the abuses.
